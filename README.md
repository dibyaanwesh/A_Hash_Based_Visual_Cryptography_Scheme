# A_Hash_Based_Visual_Cryptography_Scheme
This project helps to implement the anti-phishing framework with the help of visual cryptography. In this method we test the server that is under test through image-based authentication and it is secured and safe. A secret random image that is to be transmitted is encoded into two shares, called client share and server share. It involves the client and server storing their respective shares and then overlapping them to produce the original secret image thus authenticating the required side.
